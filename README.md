# commits.to

A website for tracking commitments. Inspired by the [I-Will System](https://doc.beeminder.com/willspec) specification, and the original https://commits.to prototype developed by the [Beeminder team](https://www.beeminder.com/).

## Gist

Ever said, "Sure, I can do XYZ by this weekend."? Ever had that pledge dissappear when a stack of other priorities show up? The goal of commits.to is to help you easily put a marker down when an important commitment is made, so that instead of vanishing into the ether, you have a place to keep track of your commitments and make sure you see them through.

commits.to has a "URL-as-UI" design. Creating a promise in commits.to is as easy as visiting a link. For example:

jladd.commits.to/mow_the_lawn_by_sunday

Just by visiting this url, commits.to brings a (draft) promise into existance. Confirm the promise and it's on the books.
